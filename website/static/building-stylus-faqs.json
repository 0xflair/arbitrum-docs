{"question": "How does Stylus manage security issues in smart contracts when interacting with so many different languages?","answer": "<p>All languages are compiled to WASM for them to be able to work with Stylus. So it just needs to verify that the produced WASM programs behave as they should inside the new virtual machine.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n","key": "how-does-stylus-manage-security-issues-in-smart-contracts-when-interacting-with-so-many-different-languages"},
{"question": "Is there any analogue of the fallback function from Solidity in the Rust Stylus SDK?","answer": "<p>Currently there isn't any analogue. However, you can use a minimal entrypoint and perform raw delegate calls, forwarding your calldata. You can find more information in <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/rust-sdk-guide#bytes-in-bytes-out-programming\">Bytes-in, bytes-out programming</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/rust-sdk-guide#call-static_call-and-delegate_call\">call, static_call and delegate_call</a>.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n","key": "is-there-any-analogue-of-the-fallback-function-from-solidity-in-the-rust-stylus-sdk"},
{"question": "Why are constructors not yet supported for Stylus contracts?","answer": "<p>Constructors use EVM bytecode to initialize state. While one could add EVM bytecode manually to their Stylus deployment, we don't allow WASM execution in the constructor so there's no way to express this in the SDK.</p>\n\n<p>We're working on models that will make init easier, so there might be better solutions available in the future. For now, we suggest calling an init method after deploying.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n","key": "why-are-constructors-not-yet-supported-for-stylus-contracts"},
{"question": "Is it possible to verify Stylus contracts on the block explorer?","answer": "<p>Currently it is not possible to verify contracts compiled to WASM on the block explorer, but we are actively working with providers to have the verification process ready for when Stylus reaches mainnet-ready status.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n","key": "is-it-possible-to-verify-stylus-contracts-on-the-block-explorer"}
