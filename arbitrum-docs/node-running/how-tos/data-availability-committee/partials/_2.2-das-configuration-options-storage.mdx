A DAS can be configured to use one or more of four storage backends:

- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket
- Files on local disk
- [Badger](https://dgraph.io/docs/badger/) database on local disk
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)

If more than one option is selected, store requests must succeed to all of them for it to be considered successful, while retrieve requests only require one of them to succeed.

If there are other storage backends you'd like us to support you can send us a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/arbitrum), or use the “Request an update” button on top of this page.
