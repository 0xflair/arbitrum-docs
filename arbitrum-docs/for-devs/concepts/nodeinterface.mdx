Arbitrum Nitro software includes a special `NodeInterface` contract available at address `0xc8` that is only accessible via RPCs (it's not actually deployed on-chain, and thus can't be called by smart contracts). The way it works is that nodes use Geth's [`InterceptRPCMessage`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/@goEthereumCommit@/internal/ethapi/api.go#L1034) hook to detect messages sent to the address `0xc8` and swaps out the message its handling before deriving a transaction from it.

The [reference page](/for-devs/dev-tools-and-resources/nodeinterface.mdx) contains information about all methods available in the NodeInterface.
